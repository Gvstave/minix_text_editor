        sunk by a whale—and that’s only the beginning In July of 1852, a
        32-year-old novelist named Herman Melville had high hopes for his new
        novel, Moby-Dick; or, The Whale, despite the book’s mixed reviews and
        tepid sales. That month he took a steamer to Nantucket for his first visit
        to the Massachusetts island, home port of his novel’s mythic protagonist,
        Captain Ahab, and his ship, the Pequod. Like a tourist, Melville met local
        dignitaries, dined out and took in the sights of the village he had
        previously only imagined. And on his last day on Nantucket he met the
        broken-down 60-year-old man who had captained the Essex, the ship that had
        been attacked and sunk by a sperm whale in an 1820 incident that had
        inspired Melville’s novel. Captain George Pollard Jr. was just 29 years
        old when the Essex went down, and he survived and returned to Nantucket to
        captain a second whaling ship, Two Brothers. But when that ship wrecked on
        a coral reef two years later, the captain was marked as unlucky at sea—a
        “Jonah”—and no owner would trust a ship to him again. Pollard lived out
        his remaining years on land, as the village night watchman. National
        Treasure: The Mold Behind the Miracle of Penicillin Melville had written
        about Pollard briefly in Moby-Dick, and only with regard to the whale
        sinking his ship. During his visit, Melville later wrote, the two merely
        “exchanged some words.” But Melville knew Pollard’s ordeal at sea did not
        end with the sinking of the Essex, and he was not about to evoke the
        horrific memories that the captain surely carried with him. “To the
        islanders he was a nobody,” Melville wrote, “to me, the most impressive
        man, tho’ wholly unassuming, even humble—that I ever encountered.” Pollard
        had told the full story to fellow captains over a dinner shortly after his
        rescue from the Essex ordeal, and to a missionary named George Bennet. To
        Bennet, the tale was like a confession. Certainly, it was grim: 92 days
        and sleepless nights at sea in a leaking boat with no food, his surviving
        crew going mad beneath the unforgiving sun, eventual cannibalism and the
        harrowing fate of two teenage boys, including Pollard’s first cousin, Owen
        Coffin. “But I can tell you no more—my head is on fire at the
        recollection,” Pollard told the missionary. “I hardly know what I say.”
        The trouble for Essex began, as Melville knew, on August 14, 1819, just
        two days after it left Nantucket on a whaling voyage that was supposed to
        last two and a half years. The 87-foot-long ship was hit by a squall that
        destroyed its topgallant sail and nearly sank it. Still, Pollard
        continued, making it to Cape Horn five weeks later. But the 20-man crew
        found the waters off South America nearly fished out, so they decided to
        sail for distant whaling grounds in the South Pacific, far from any
        shores. To restock, the Essex anchored at Charles Island in the Galapagos,
        where the crew collected sixty 100-pound tortoises. As a prank, one of the
        crew set a fire, which, in the dry season, quickly spread. Pollard’s men
        barely escaped, having to run through flames, and a day after they set
        sail, they could still see smoke from the burning island. Pollard was
        furious, and swore vengeance on whoever set the fire. Many years later
        Charles Island was still a blackened wasteland, and the fire was believed
        to have caused the extinction of both the Floreana Tortoise and the
        Floreana Mockingbird. Essex First Mate Owen Chase, later in life. Photo:
        Wikimedia Commons By November of 1820, after months of a prosperous voyage
        and a thousand miles from the nearest land, whaleboats from the Essex had
        harpooned whales that dragged them out toward the horizon in what the crew
        called “Nantucket sleigh rides.” Owen Chase, the 23-year-old first mate,
        had stayed aboard the Essex to make repairs while Pollard went whaling. It
        was Chase who spotted a very big whale—85 feet in length, he
        estimated—lying quietly in the distance, its head facing the ship. Then,
        after two or three spouts, the giant made straight for the Essex, “coming
        down for us at great celerity,” Chase would recall—at about three knots.
        The whale smashed head-on into the ship with “such an appalling and
        tremendous jar, as nearly threw us all on our faces.” The whale passed
        underneath the ship and began thrashing in the water. “I could distinctly
        see him smite his jaws together, as if distracted with rage and fury,”
        Chase recalled. Then the whale disappeared. The crew was addressing the
        hole in the ship and getting the pumps working when one man cried out,
        “Here he is—he is making for us again.” Chase spotted the whale, his head
        half out of water, bearing down at great speed—this time at six knots,
        Chase thought. This time it hit the bow directly under the cathead and
        disappeared for good. The water rushed into the ship so fast, the only
        thing the crew could do was lower the boats and try fill them with
        navigational instruments, bread, water and supplies before the Essex
        turned over on its side. Pollard saw his ship in distress from a distance,
        then returned to see the Essex in ruin. Dumbfounded, he asked, “My God,
        Mr. Chase, what is the matter?” “We have been stove by a whale,” his first
        mate answered. Another boat returned, and the men sat in silence, their
        captain still pale and speechless. Some, Chase observed, “had no idea of
        the extent of their deplorable situation.” The men were unwilling to leave
        the doomed Essex as it slowly foundered, and Pollard tried to come up with
        a plan. In all, there were three boats and 20 men. They calculated that
        the closest land was the Marquesas Islands and the Society Islands, and
        Pollard wanted to set off for them—but in one of the most ironic decisions
        in nautical history, Chase and the crew convinced him that those islands
        were peopled with cannibals and that the crew’s best chance for survival
        would be to sail south. The distance to land would be far greater, but
        they might catch the trade winds or be spotted by another whaling ship.
        Only Pollard seemed to understand the implications of steering clear of
        the islands. (According to Nathaniel Philbrick, in his book In the Heart
        of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex, although rumors of
        cannibalism persisted, traders had been visiting the islands without
        incident.) Thus they left the Essex aboard their 20-foot boats. They were
        challenged almost from the start. Saltwater saturated the bread, and the
        men began to dehydrate as they ate their daily rations. The sun was
        ravaging. Pollard’s boat was attacked by a killer whale. They spotted
        land—Henderson Island—two weeks later, but it was barren. After another
        week the men began to run out of supplies. Still, three of them decided
        they’d rather take their chances on land than climb back into a boat. No
        one could blame them. And besides, it would stretch the provisions for the
        men in the boats. Herman Melville drew inspiration for Moby-Dick from the
        1820 whale attack on the Essex. Photo: Wikimedia Commons By mid-December,
        after weeks at sea, the boats began to take on water, more whales menaced
        the men at night, and by January, the paltry rations began to take their
        toll. On Chase’s boat, one man went mad, stood up and demanded a dinner
        napkin and water, then fell into “most horrid and frightful convulsions”
        before perishing the next morning. “Humanity must shudder at the dreadful
        recital” of what came next, Chase wrote. The crew “separated limbs from
        his body, and cut all the flesh from the bones; after which, we opened the
        body, took out the heart, and then closed it again—sewed it up as decently
        as we could, and committed it to the sea.” They then roasted the man’s
        organs on a flat stone and ate them. Over the coming week, three more
        sailors died, and their bodies were cooked and eaten. One boat
        disappeared, and then Chase’s and Pollard’s boats lost sight of each
        other. The rations of human flesh did not last long, and the more the
        survivors ate, the hungrier they felt. On both boats the men became too
        weak to talk. The four men on Pollard’s boat reasoned that without more
        food, they would die. On February 6, 1821—nine weeks after they’d bidden
        farewell to the Essex—Charles Ramsdell, a teenager, proposed they draw
        lots to determine who would be eaten next. It was the custom of the sea,
        dating back, at least in recorded instance, to the first half of the 17th
        century. The men in Pollard’s boat accepted Ramsdell’s suggestion, and the
        lot fell to young Owen Coffin, the captain’s first cousin. Pollard had
        promised the boy’s mother he’d look out for him. “My lad, my lad!” the
        captain now shouted, “if you don’t like your lot, I’ll shoot the first man
        that touches you.” Pollard even offered to step in for the boy, but Coffin
        would have none of it. “I like it as well as any other,” he said. Ramsdell
        drew the lot that required him to shoot his friend. He paused a long time.
        But then Coffin rested his head on the boat’s gunwale and Ramsdell pulled
        the trigger. “He was soon dispatched,” Pollard would say, “and nothing of
        him left.” By February 18, after 89 days at sea, the last three men on
        Chase’s boat spotted a sail in the distance. After a frantic chase, they
        managed to catch the English ship Indian and were rescued. Three hundred
        miles away, Pollard’s boat carried only its captain and Charles Ramsdell.
        They had only the bones of the last crewmen to perish, which they smashed
        on the bottom of the boat so that they could eat the marrow. As the days
        passed the two men obsessed over the bones scattered on the boat’s floor.
        Almost a week after Chase and his men had been rescued, a crewman aboard
        the American ship Dauphin spotted Pollard’s boat. Wretched and confused,
        Pollard and Ramsdell did not rejoice at their rescue, but simply turned to
        the bottom of their boat and stuffed bones into their pockets. Safely
        aboard the Dauphin, the two delirious men were seen “sucking the bones of
        their dead mess mates, which they were loath to part with.” The five Essex
        survivors were reunited in Valparaiso, where they recuperated before
        sailing back for Nantucket. As Philbrick writes, Pollard had recovered
        enough to join several captains for dinner, and he told them the entire
        story of the Essex wreck and his three harrowing months at sea. One of the
        captains present returned to his room and wrote everything down, calling
        Pollard’s account “the most distressing narrative that ever came to my
        knowledge.” Years later, the third boat was discovered on Ducie Island;
        three skeletons were aboard. Miraculously, the three men who chose to stay
        on Henderson Island survived for nearly four months, mostly on shellfish
        and bird eggs, until an Australian ship rescued them. Once they arrived in
        Nantucket, the surviving crewmen of the Essex were welcomed, largely
        without judgment. Cannibalism in the most dire of circumstances, it was
        reasoned, was a custom of the sea. (In similar incidents, survivors
        declined to eat the flesh of the dead but used it as bait for fish. But
        Philbrick notes that the men of the Essex were in waters largely devoid of
        marine life at the surface.) Captain Pollard, however, was not as easily
        forgiven, because he had eaten his cousin. (One scholar later referred to
        the act as “gastronomic incest.”) Owen Coffin’s mother could not abide
        being in the captain’s presence. Once his days at sea were over, Pollard
        spent the rest of his life in Nantucket. Once a year, on the anniversary
        of the wreck of the Essex, he was said to have locked himself in his room
        and fasted in honor of his lost crewmen. By 1852, Melville and Moby-Dick
        had begun their own slide into obscurity. Despite the author’s hopes, his
        book sold but a few thousand copies in his lifetime, and Melville, after a
        few more failed attempts at novels, settled into a reclusive life and
        spent 19 years as a customs inspector in New York City. He drank and
        suffered the death of his two sons. Depressed, he abandoned novels for
        poetry. But George Pollard’s fate was never far from his mind. In his poem
        Clarel he writes of; A night patrolman on the quay Watching the bales till
        morning hour Through fair and foul. Never he smiled; Call him, and he
        would come; not sour In spirit, but meek and reconciled: Patient he was,
        he none withstood; Oft on some secret thing would brood.
